### Motivating Naive Bayes:
1% of women at age forty who participate in routine screening have breast cancer.  80% of women with breast cancer will get positive mammographies.  9.6% of women without breast cancer will also get positive mammographies.  A woman in this age group had a positive mammography in a routine screening.  What is the probability that she actually has breast cancer?

* Prior: 1% of women at age forty have breast cancer.
* Posterior: Probability woman has breast cancer
